Assignment No1
2d-4c-no4.dat: Contains 863 rows. Each row represents a data point, the first two values of the row refers to the features values of the data point the last value refers to the pre labeled cluster that the point is belong to.
Write K-Mean clustering program (choose your language) to cluster the data point into 4 clusters using the following criteria 
1. The center of each cluster is defined as the mean point of the data points that belongs to the cluster (The mean point is computed by taking the mean of each single dimension of the data points of the cluster)
2. The center of each cluster is defined as the median point of the data points that belongs to the cluster (The median point is computed by taking the median of each single dimension of the data points of the cluster)
For each method compute:
1. The Sum of Squared Error (SSE)
2. The Average Recall
3. The Average Precision
Compare and interpret your result for the two methods
What to submit
1. A file that includes your code
2. A word file that includes the SSE, Recall, Precision and the interpret of your result
